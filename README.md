# Women's Health Navigator for Low Resource Settings

A mobile-friendly chatbot application focused on women's health in low-resource settings, designed to improve healthcare system navigation and service utilization in Pune, India.

## Project Overview

Most healthcare systems in low resource settings are disjointed and complex to navigate. Information, access, and usage remain well below national targets. This project aims to address the challenge of how women can remain engaged in their health systems and make more informed health decisions when Community Health Workers (CHWs) are overburdened and information is not consolidated.

**Our solution uses generative AI to develop a network of chatbots that communicate with patients using large language models (LLMs), recommended by CHWs, local clinics, and women's associations.**

## Key Features

- üåê **Health System Navigation**: Guides women through the complex healthcare journey
- üè• **Local Service Integration**: Connects users to nearby clinics and healthcare providers
- üì± **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Accessible on smartphones via text messaging
- üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Personalized Care Pathways**: Tailored guidance based on individual needs
